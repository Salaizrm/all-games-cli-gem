GENERAL IDEA:

This CLI when prompted should return any and all info(recent) regarding videogame(s).

Name, release date, what platforms it will be available on, company developing game, description and USRB(games rating)
WILL list all videogames for this year when prompted (lists corresponding dates to game).
lists all videogames in a given month when prompted.
then asks for input ("type the name of the game you'd like to view").
Can search for specific game.
I want this CLI to scrape from a gaming website.(https://www.gameinformer.com/2020)
